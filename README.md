<!-- README for Recipe Website Project -->
<p>
  This project is a simple recipe website created as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The main goal of this project is to build a functional and structured website using only HTML. By working on this project, I aim to strengthen my understanding of HTML elements, tags, and document structure. The website will include multiple recipe pages, internal links for navigation, and proper use of headings, paragraphs, lists, and images. Upon completion, I will have demonstrated the ability to create a multi-page website, use semantic HTML effectively, and organize content in a user-friendly format.
